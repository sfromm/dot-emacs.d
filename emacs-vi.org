* Emacs vi emulation

While I have been using Emacs again for several years, I still have
quite a bit of Vim muscle memory.  [[https://gitorious.org/evil/pages/Home][evil]] provides an emulation mode that
I find extremely useful.

This also sets the initial state of some modes to _emacs_ where it makes
sense.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (sf/package-install 'evil)
  (use-package evil
    :init
    (evil-mode 1)
    :config
    (progn
      (dolist (mode '(bbdb-mode erc-mode fundamental-mode shell-mode calendar-mode message-mode special-mode ))
        (evil-set-initial-state mode 'emacs))
      ))
#+END_SRC

* Postamble

Finally, offer module for use.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(provide 'emacs-vi)
#+END_SRC
