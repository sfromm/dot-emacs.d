* Magit

I use [[http://magit.github.io/][magit]], the emacs mode for [[http://git-scm.com/][git]].  It can be used to review diffs,
commit, push changes, and other things.  Documentation is available in
_info_ and [[http://magit.github.io/master/magit.html][online]].  This also installs [[https://github.com/pidu/git-timemachine][git-timemachine]], a way of
navigating a file's history in [[http://git-scm.com/][git]].
