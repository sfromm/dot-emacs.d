* Personalized configuration

The goal is to leverage Emacs' customization facility to handle
miscellaneous personal settings.  One can either set the variables
directly or use =M-x customize= them.  The manual has information on
[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Customization.html#Customization][Customization Settings]].

First create the customization group(s).

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defgroup sf-emacs nil
    "Personalized configuration for Emacs"
    :prefix "sf-custom/")
#+END_SRC

Create customization variables related to email.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defcustom sf-custom/abuse-mail-cc nil
    "What email address should be CC'd on forwarding of abuse-related reports?"
    :group 'sf-emacs
    :type 'string)

  (defcustom sf-custom/email-work nil
    "Work-related email account?"
    :group 'sf-emacs
    :type 'string)

  (defcustom sf-custom/smtp-user-work nil
    "Work-related SMTP username?"
    :group 'sf-emacs
    :type 'string)

  (defcustom sf-custom/smtp-server-work nil
    "Work-related SMTP server name?"
    :group 'sf-emacs
    :type 'string)

  (defcustom sf-custom/email-personal nil
    "Personal-related email account?"
    :group 'sf-emacs
    :type 'string)

  (defcustom sf-custom/smtp-user-personal nil
    "Personal-related SMTP username?"
    :group 'sf-emacs
    :type 'string)

  (defcustom sf-custom/smtp-server-personal nil
    "Personal-related SMTP server name?"
    :group 'sf-emacs
    :type 'string)

  (defcustom sf-custom/gnus-alias-alist nil
    "An alist of alternate identities used by gnus-alias."
    :group 'sf-emacs
    :type 'alist)

  (defcustom sf-custom/gnus-alias-identity-rules nil
    "An alist of rules for identity selection used by gnus-alias."
    :group 'sf-emacs
    :type 'alist)
#+END_SRC

Create customization variables for Jabber and ERC.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defcustom sf-custom/jabber-account-alist nil
    "An alist defining Jabber accounts"
    :group 'sf-emacs
    :type 'alist)

  (defcustom sf-custom/erc-nick nil
    "ERC nick to use?"
    :group 'sf-emacs
    :type 'string)

  (defcustom sf-custom/erc-away-nick nil
    "ERC nick to use when away?"
    :group 'sf-emacs
    :type 'string)

  (defcustom sf-custom/erc-channels-alist nil
    "An alist of IRC channels to auto-join."
    :group 'sf-emacs
    :type 'alist)

  (defcustom sf-custom/erc-keywords nil
    "A list of ERC keywords to highlight."
    :group 'sf-emacs
    :type 'alist)
